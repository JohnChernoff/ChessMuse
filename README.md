Chess to something vaguely resembling Music

This project aims to sonify a chess game with each move (such as, say, "e2e4") representing potentially four pitches (eight musical notes, eight ranks, eight files).  

Currently only the destination square is used (such as "e4" from "e2e4") and pawn moves have a special function of setting the current octave that pitches will sound within. 

Also, a more sustained melodic line is formed from the coordinates of squares where captures occur.

Future plans include real-time synthesis of a game (over, say, lichess) as well as volume and tempo controls.
